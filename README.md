# Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems - TypeScript Solutions

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of the classic [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/).

## About the Problems

The Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems are a collection of programming exercises designed to practice logic programming skills. These problems range from basic list operations to more complex algorithms, providing excellent practice for understanding recursive thinking and functional programming concepts.

## AI Assistance

I've used AI assistance (Cursor) in two specific areas:

1. **Test Generation**: AI was used to generate comprehensive test cases for each problem, ensuring edge cases and various scenarios are covered
2. **Complexity Analysis**: AI helped annotate the Big O time and space complexity for each solution

## Running the Code

```bash
# Run a specific problem
deno run exercises/P01_last.ts

# Run tests for a specific problem
deno test exercises/P01_last_test.ts

# Run all tests
deno test
```
